    <h1 class="title">Reflections</h1>
    <h2 class="first-sub-title">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h1>
    <p>I have learnt that I have difficulty asking for help when stuck on a problem.  I dont want to appear stupid or seem I am struggling.
      It was hard for me to posting my blogs everyweek to discord.  Putting myself out there for others to review my work continues to be challenging.
      Also came to realise how much of a fixed mindset I had at the start of this course. Saw mistakes or areas where I got stuck as failures, not as areas to grow.
      </p>
   
    <h3 class="sub-title">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
    <p>
      View this process of learning programming as a challenge.  Its ok not to know everything, mistakes are going to happen.  
      Showing empathy towards yourself and others.  Understanding that everyone is learning at different levels and not to judge people for their mistakes.
      Being aware of your mindset, are you open to learning new skills?  If you get stuck on a problem, understanding when to take a break away from the computer, or when to ask for help.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="sub-title">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    <p>What surprised me the most during the different core learning’s was how much of a fixed mind-set I had.  
      Which at the start of learning a new skill, in this case coding I had multiple moments where I felt it was too hard, and I couldn’t do it.  
      However after a few weeks of foundations I could start to feel my mind set changing.  
      Being ok with not knowing how to do something, and viewing times where I am stuck or overwhelmed as challenges rather than failures.</p>
   
    <h3 class="sub-title">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    <p>Before this course it has been awhile since I had to write anything but emails.  
      Having to write blog posts was very challenging at the start.  
      I would sit for ages looking at a blank computer screen not knowing where to start.  
      I found that just writing bullet points helped me start the process, and over the weeks it has become easier.
      Posting the blogs to the discord, putting yourself out there to be reviewed was and still is challenging.
      </p>
       
    <h3 class="sub-title">•	Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
    <p>The boot camp course is short and intense learning.  Spending time on core learning skills will help teach people of to deal with stressful situations and not burn out.
      Also learning coding for the first time can be hard.  Adding the core skills every week helps break up the coding to avoid people feeling overwhelmed.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="sub-title">•	Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
    <p>For me the time spent learning core has been very helpful in a number of ways.
      Firstly after years of not studying having to think and write out blogs have defiantly helped me get back into the learning mindset.  
      The content of Core has also helped me deal with learning the new, very foreign, skill of coding.  
      Helping me think about my mental health, meditation, viewing times where I am overwhelmed as challenges and times for learning rather than failures.
      Looking back at the past few weeks, I have enjoyed learning the technical side so far, but having the break away from coding that the core section provides was a vital part.
