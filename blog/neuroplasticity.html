    <h1 class="title">Neuroplasticity</h1>
    <h2 class="first-sub-title">How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h1>
    <p>If people understand the principles of neuroplasticity and that your brain is adaptable, it can motivate you to continue learning/trying new skills.  
      This will lead to an overall improvement in memory and general cognitive skills.</p>
   
    <h3 class="sub-title">How you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit</h3>
    <p>Deciding to take this course was a big step for me, and through this learning a completely new skill and interacting with new people will help increase my neuroplasticity. 
      Also, understanding that my brain is not set and that I can adapt and learn new things. 
      Making sure I get enough sleep to improve brain function the next day/repair, 
      along with regular exercise to increase blood flow to brain are two other principals of neuroplasticity I will attempt to improve moving forward.</p>
    
    <h3 class="sub-title">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
    <p>Throughout your life there are a number of ways to increase your overall neuroplasticity.   
      Some of these ways include;</p>
      
      <p> - Keeping your mind stimulated with puzzles or games</p>
        <p> - Lifelong learning through new skills and experiences</p>
          <p> - Physical exercise will increase blood flow to the brain</p>
            <p> - Sleeping 7-9 hours a night and meditation will have restorative impact on your brain

    <h1 class="second-title">Growth Mindset</h1>
    
    <h3 class="sub-title">What is a Growth Mindset and why is it relevant?</h3>
    <p>Growth mindset is the belief that your intellect is not set and can be developed / improved over time.  
      If you have a growth mindset you are more likely to view setbacks/failures as a chance for growth.  
      It is relevant because it can increase a person’s resilience when dealing with challenging situations and encourages constant learning/improvement.  
      People with growth mindsets can be more adaptable and have an increased chance of completing goals.  
      </p>
    
    <h3 class="sub-title">Did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
    <p>Reading through the information I defiantly fall into the fixed mindset category.  
      Thinking back over the past few years a lot of my thinking was static and mostly negative.  
      I avoided challenging situations and if I did start a new endeavour, often gave up easily.
      Deciding to take part in this course and try something completely new was defiantly out of my comfort zone, but hopefully a step towards more of a growth mindset.
      </p>
    
    <h3 class="sub-title">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
    <p>There are a couple of ways I plan to integrate the growth mindset going forward.
      Firstly to embrace the challenge of this course.  
      It will be hard and there will be times when I feel completely out of my depth, but I need to except that it’s ok and keep moving forward.
      I also need to view mistakes as an opportunity for learning not as failure.  
      </p>

    <!-----make this a link//---->

    <h3 class="sub-title">Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy. </h3>
    <p>My biggest takeaway from this research would be to shift my mindset when it comes to mistakes or failures.   
      During this course when I make mistakes or feel out of my depth I need to start viewing it as a challenge or areas for learning.
      Another update to my learning plan would be to make sure I’m taking care of myself.  
      Making sure I get enough mental rest with a good 7-9 hours sleep a night and morning meditation.  
      Also the physical health with regular exercise to increase blood flow and thinking more about what types of food will have the best effect on my brain.
