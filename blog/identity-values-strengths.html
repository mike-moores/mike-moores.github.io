    <h1 class="title">Identity, Values & Strengths</h1>
    <h2 class="first-sub-title">Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.  </h2>
    <p>A few years ago while riding my bicycle to work I was hit by a taxi.  I was riding along a cycle lane on the side of the road when he pulled out of a driveway without looking.  I was knocked off and my bike went under his car.  My first feeling was shock and anger, mainly towards the damage to my bike.  I was taken to hospital, and after x-rays and doctors examination was lucky to escape with only a badly bruised leg.  After a couple of days I had to write a statement to the police and give my suggestion on if the driver should be punished.  Although I was still angry at this point, I wasn’t severely injured and had insurance on my bike.  I didn’t want this event to cost the driver his license/job and possibly affect his family. In my statement, I decided not to recommend that police pursue charges. In the end I received an apology letter from the driver along with $400 to cover my insurance excess.
      Looking back on this decision I am glad that my initial anger didn’t influence the outcome.

    <h3 class="sub-title">Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
    <p>The influence on my identity can be broken into two sections. Firstly when growing up with my parents and then after meeting my wife.</p>
      <p>My parents moved to New Zealand from the UK when my brother and I were very young.  I don’t remember much of the culture from the UK, but we quickly adopted the kiwi way of life.  It was a stable family life growing up and even though we had no other family here my parents made sure that we always had lots of “chosen family” around.  I was always supported in anything I wanted to try and was taught to always treat other with respect and kindness.</p> 
      <p>My wife Amie has also had a large influence on my identity.  Since we met she has challenged my views on the world, forcing me to re-think my preconceived ideas. To this day she is constantly pushing me to be a better person.
      </p>
    <h3 class="sub-title">Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
    <p>My strengths are represented by my stage in life; I have a stable environment with a great support system of my wife and family.  I also know what it’s like to fail, which makes me more determined to succeed in the future and I know what mistakes to avoid for the best outcome. </p>
    <h3 class="sub-title">Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h3>
    <p>My stage in life also applies some learning limitations.  My previous job I had for a number of years and was on auto pilot most days.  This means I have not studied or learned a new skill in some time and going into full time study has taken some adjusting.  </p>
    <h3 class="sub-title">Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
    <p>During my previous job there was a person on my team who was a challenge to work with productively.  They were a nice, thoughtful person but would constantly delay projects by asking a variety of pointless questions.  I tried to have patience and understanding however the process was extremely frustrating.  
      Reflecting on this now, I would have tried allocating time before the project started to go through any questions or thoughts they had.  This may have avoided lost time during the project.
