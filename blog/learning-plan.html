  <h1 class="title">Learning Plan - Bootcamp</h1>

  <h2 class="first-sub-title">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
  <p>I have no specific destination in mind after completing the Dev Academy course.
    I have enjoyed what I have learned so far, and my only short term goal would be to gain employment where I can
    continue to learn.
    Long term I would like to be able to contract work anywhere in the world.</p>

  <h3 class="sub-title">What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
  <p>My strengths are pretty much the same as the previous foundations learning plan.
    Having a stable home environment with great family support.
    Reminding myself of miss opportunities and past failures gives me the determination to complete the bootcamp.
    Although the foundations has helped a great deal, I am still getting used to learning again.
    A possible limitation moving into bootcamp would be how I handle the increased work load and time commitments.
  </p>

  <h3 class="sub-title">What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
  <p>My biggest non-technical challenge at bootcamp would probably be to manage my time properly.
    I have a tendency to leave things to the last minute and then get overwhelmed as the deadline approaches. </p>

  <h3 class="sub-title">What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at
    Dev Academy?</h3>
  <p>As stated in the previous learning plan, in both my person and professional life I tend to procrastinate and leave
    tasks to the last minute.
    I have been working on this throughout foundations; however I hope that I continue to improve on this throughout the
    rest of the course.
    I have also realised throughout foundations that I am not good with asking for help.
    Not wanting to seem stupid or struggling.
    As I am sure bootcamp will be full of times where I feel lost I would like to continue to work on this.
  </p>

  <h3 class="sub-title">What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
  <p>Just like my expectations for foundations, I expect response to questions or calls for help within a reasonable
    timeframe.
    Also to first provide hints about where to go next rather than providing answers.</p>

  <h3 class="sub-title">What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
  <p>As I am part of the online bootcamp, the dev-academy discord will be the first place I seek help.
    Throughout foundations there are always been facilitators available to provide assistance in a timely manner, I
    imaging this will be the same for bootcamp.
    Managing workload will be a big priority for me.
    Looking at the week ahead and breaking down the tasks into timeframes day by day.
    Making sure that if I am working with others that I am up to date and ready to go.
    Don’t want to negatively affect other peoples learning.
  </p>

  <h1 class="second-title">Learning Plan - Foundations</h1>

  <h2 class="first-sub-title">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
    <p>Long term I want to be confident in my ability as a developer. To have the ability to work remotely anywhere in
      the world. My ideal pathway forward would be to gain employment after Dev Academy where I can continue to learn.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-title">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
    <p>When it comes to learning I have many strengths and limitations.
      My strengths are represented by my stage in life; I have a stable environment with a great support system of my
      wife and family. I also know what it’s like to fail, which makes me more determine to succeed in the future and
      what mistakes to avoid for the best outcome.
      My stage in life also applies some learning limitations. My previous job I had for a number of years and was on
      auto pilot most days. This means I have not studied or learned a new skill in some time and going into full time
      study has taken some adjusting.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-title">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself
      while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>In both my personal and professional lives I have a tendency to procrastinate and leave things to the last
      minute. Therefore time management would be the skill I would like to develop during this Dev Academy course. </p>

    <h3 class="sub-title">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h3>
    <p>I commit to starting my work day at 8:30am, and take breaks away from the computer at least 10mins every 2 hours
      and at least 1 hour for lunch. If workload/stress starts to build I commit to stepping away from the computer,
      going for a walk or other exercise. I will then break the task into smaller steps to complete one at a time,
      reducing the stress of the overall picture.</p>

    <h3 class="sub-title">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
    <p>If I am stuck on an issue for more than 30 mins I commit to first asking my home group/cohort for advice via
      discord. If I am still stuck I will reach out to the Dev Academy facilitators for help.</p>

    <h3 class="sub-title">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>From the facilitator team I expect responses to questions within a reasonable timeframe. To ensure the best
      learning outcome I would also expect the facilitators to provide hints for solutions rather than spelling out the
      answer.</p>

    <h3 class="sub-title">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For
      example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
    <p>Apart from walking the dog every morning, I have no regular commitments that I would need to schedule time.</p>
