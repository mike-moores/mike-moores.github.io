    <h1 class="title">Learning Plan</h1>
    <h2 class="first-sub-title">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h1>
    <p>Long term I want to be confident in my ability as a developer.  To have the ability to work remotely anywhere in the world.  My ideal pathway forward would be to gain employment after Dev Academy where I can continue to learn.</p>
   
    <h3 class="sub-title">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
    <p>When it comes to learning I have many strengths and limitations. 
      My strengths are represented by my stage in life; I have a stable environment with a great support system of my wife and family.  I also know what it’s like to fail, which makes me more determine to succeed in the future and what mistakes to avoid for the best outcome. 
      My stage in life also applies some learning limitations.  My previous job I had for a number of years and was on auto pilot most days.  This means I have not studied or learned a new skill in some time and going into full time study has taken some adjusting.  
      </p>
    
    <h3 class="sub-title">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
    <p>In both my personal and professional lives I have a tendency to procrastinate and leave things to the last minute.  Therefore time management would be the skill I would like to develop during this Dev Academy course. </p>
    
    <h3 class="sub-title">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h3>
    <p>I commit to starting my work day at 8:30am, and take breaks away from the computer at least 10mins every 2 hours and at least 1 hour for lunch. If workload/stress starts to build I commit to stepping away from the computer, going for a walk or other exercise.  I will then break the task into smaller steps to complete one at a time, reducing the stress of the overall picture.</p>
    
    <h3 class="sub-title">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
    <p>If I am stuck on an issue for more than 30 mins I commit to first asking my home group/cohort for advice via discord.  If I am still stuck I will reach out to the Dev Academy facilitators for help.</p>
    
    <h3 class="sub-title">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
    <p>From the facilitator team I expect responses to questions within a reasonable timeframe.   To ensure the best learning outcome I would also expect the facilitators to provide hints for solutions rather than spelling out the answer.</p>
    
    <h3 class="sub-title">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
    <p>Apart from walking the dog every morning, I have no regular commitments that I would need to schedule time.</p>
