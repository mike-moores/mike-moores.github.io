    <h1 class="title">Problem Solving</h1>
    <h2 class="first-sub-title">Simple Problem</h1>
    <p>Last week I was trying to run a simple program but the code just wouldn’t work.   
      I didn’t have the confidence that the code I was writing was correct when all that was wrong was a missing capital letter.  
      I first started googling the task trying to find out where I was going wrong then kept trying different ways of writing the code, nothing worked.  
      I got up and walked away from the computer for 5 mins, came back and started checking the code in detail.
      This process was very frustrating but in reflection I understood that details matter a lot when coding.  Capital letters missing or in the wrong place can derail the whole code.
      </p>
   
    <h3 class="sub-title">Elegantly solved problem</h3>
    <p>Earlier this week I was working through an exercise where the code needed a loop to work.  
      I was not feeling confident with this process and just starred at the empty screen not knowing where to begin.
      I stopped for a moment, and then firstly talked over the problem out loud to myself. I then wrote out in pseudocode what I was trying to accomplish step by step.  
      I Then attempted to write the code, trying different methods but when that didn’t work I searched google for some tips.
      The overall process felt much calmer and more productive.  
      Just taking time to break down what you are trying to do and where you are getting stuck helped with both trying to fix the issue and also learning where I went wrong.
      </p>
    
    <h3 class="sub-title">Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
    <p>•	Pseudocode - Semi confident using pseudocode.  
      However I have been writing in a note book rather than commenting in the code.  
      Moving forwards I will try and write the pseudocode inside the code.</p>

      <p> •	Trying something – very confident with this technique.  
      Has been my go too so far.</p>
      
      <p> •	Rubber ducky method – This method was also surprisingly effective.  
      I don’t have a rubber ducky, but talking the problem out loud to myself worked well.</p>
      
      <p>•	Reading error messages – I am getting better at readying the error messages when trying to problem solve.  
      I can see how useful it can be, just need more practice.</p>
      
      <p> •	Console.logging – Same as reading error messages, getting the hang of console logging results, just need more practice.</p> 
      
      <p>•	Googling – Very confident with this problem solving tool.  
      Sometimes getting the answer is quick, but digging into what the code is doing and why can be a bit trickier to discover.</p>
      
      <p>•	Asking your peers for help – Not confident with this method yet.  
      Although I do feel this will get easier over time as we get to know each other.</p>
      
      <p> •	Asking coaches for help – Confident with asking the coaches for help, getting over the public posting in the discord is my main barrier here.</p>
      
      <p> •	Improving your process with reflection – over the past week I have gained more confidence with reflecting on the code I have just written.  
      Going back and adjusting to make the code more readable.
      </p>
    
    <h3 class="sub-title">Asking for Help</h3>
    <p>At the start of last week I got stuck on one of the first questions of an exercise.  
      I spent about 30-45mins going over and over it to try and work out where I was going wrong.  
      All the given information and google searches seemed to be saying my code was correct but it still wouldn’t work.
      I knew that I had to post in the discord asking for help but felt incredibly stupid since it was one of the first questions and pretty straight forward.  
      I eventually did post asking for help, and after a little investigation it turned out to be an issue lower on the page, nothing to do with the code I had written.
      I think spending at least 30 mins trying to debug for myself is the correct starting point, however next time I won’t hesitate to ask for help when I find myself still stuck.
