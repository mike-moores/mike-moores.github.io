    <h2 class="first-sub-title">JavaScript, HTML & CSS</h1>
    <p>When looking at the relationship between JavaScript, HTML and CSS think of the web like a library, with a large collection of books.</p>
      <p>Html is the library’s structure and organiser. It determines where the books are located on the shelves, how they are organised and how the readers access them.</p>
      <p>CSS is the library’s design and feel.  This could be represented with paint or artwork on the walls, the type of furniture and the lighting.  CSS would determine how the books are displayed and if the library is a nice place to spend time.</p>  
      <p>JavaScript would then be the librarian, providing the interactive and functional design to the library.    It would help the customers apply for a library card,  find books and then check them out.</p>
      <p>All three combined they aim to provide the customer with a nice place to experience and make the information easy to find and access.
      </p>
   
    <h3 class="sub-title">Control flow & Loops</h3>
    <p>Control flow is the order of actions or decisions that are carried out in a process.
      An everyday example of this would be cooking a meal from a cookbook.  Control flow would determine the steps needed to be carried out in order to make the dish correctly.
      You would first decide on what dish to make, then go shopping for the ingredients.  Next you would prepare the ingredients for cooking and finally add the items to the pot in the order provided. 
      </p>
      <p>Loops are a process of repeating a task until the condition you are looking for is met.  Again we can use cooking a dish as an example.  While cooking the dish you will periodically check the seasoning.</p>  
      <p>First taste --> Does it need salt? Yes --> Add salt, NO --> continue cooking.  This loop will continue until the dish has enough salt.</p>
    
    <h3 class="sub-title">The DOM</h3>
    <p>The Document Object Model or DOM is an interface for HTML documents.  It represents the structure of a webpage via a hierarchy and translates the content of a HTML into objects that JavaScript and access and modify.  The DOM is needed so that dynamic web pages can display and function properly</p>
    <p>Using an example from this week’s sprint;
      We wanted to add a button to the JavaScript Café web page in order to generate a customer order.  The DOM allows JavaScript to find the button in HTML, make the button activate when clicked on and finally to assign the button the task of generating the customer’s order.

    <h3 class="sub-title">Arrays & Objects</h3>
    <p>Arrays and objects are both data structures used to store and organise data but they have different ways of accessing the data.</p>
    <p>Arrays are an ordered collection of elements stored in an index and are best utilised with a list of similar items such as numbers or strings.  They are useful because an array can hold multiple values under a single name with each element being assigned a number value.  The first element in the array is represented by a 0 then 1, 2….. etc.  </p>
    <p>Objects are used to represent a ‘thing’ in your code.  This ‘thing’ is a container made up of a number of properties and could represent a variety of data e.g. a person, plant, animal, or car.
      Inside the container we can store multiple properties about the ‘thing’.  If we look at a car for example, we could store its make, model, year built and colour.  
      </p>
    <h3 class="sub-title">Functions</h3>
    <p>Functions are a section of code that performs a specific task or a set of related tasks. 
      A simple example of this would be adding two numbers together;
      </p>
    <p>Function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
      Return num1 + num2;
    }
    </p>
      <p>There are a number of ways that functions are helpful when writing a program.  
      Firstly they provide the ability to break the program down into steps. 
      They also allow us to use the same code multiple times instead of rewriting it; this is useful when you want to use a selection of arguments that produce different results.  
      Functions can also be used to test a small part of the code without affecting the entire program.
